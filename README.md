# Efficient constrained Gaussian processes for shape restricted function estimation using elliptical slice sampling (ESS)
This repository contains R codes and functions for implementing the efficient constrained Gaussian processes for shape restricted function estimate using Elliptical Slice Sampling (ESS) based on Maatouk et al. (2024b), and Maatouk and Bay (2017). Furthermore, it includes two functions for generating very large Gaussian vectors extracted from stationary Gaussian processes. The approach developed in this repository can incopporate multiple shape constraints such as monotonicity, boundedness and convexity, and estimated the hyperparameters.
